        <p> <b>Subject: <u>Devsnest Codecamp</u> </b></p>
        <p>Sir,</p>
        <div class="bodyofletter">I would like to conduct a codecamp in our college organised by <span class="Devsnest">Devsnest</span>. 
            The purpose of this codecamp will be to make students interview ready.
            <emp>Devsnest is a non-profit organisation which provides 1 month code camp,free of cost, to help students
            get their dream job.
            They also provide jobs and internships based on skills through their hiring partners and network.</emp>
            It is therefore important for students to have this opportunity.
            <br>
            This workshop will be beneficial for all the students and would help them to make connections as the course is based on peer-learning.
            The camp will start from 01/06/2021 and will end on 30/06/21.
            <br>
            <p>
                The following activities are going to happen: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data structures and algorithms</li>
                    <li>Coding contests</li>
